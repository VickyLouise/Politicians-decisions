This converts HTML files containing the text of the Congressional Record into structured text data. I use it to extract speeches by members of Congress.

It is adapted from:

Judd, Nicholas, Dan Drinkard, Jeremy Carbaugh, and Lindsay Young. *congressional-record: A parser for the Congressional Record.* Chicago, IL: 2017.

I reproduce the code with modification under a BD3 licence. The appropriate copyright and conditions are included in LICENCE. I am grateful to Judd et al. and the Sunlight Foundation for their work.
