# congressional-record

This converts HTML files containing the text of the Congressional Record into structured text data. I use it to extract speeches by members of Congress.

It is adapted from:

Judd, Nicholas, Dan Drinkard, Jeremy Carbaugh, and Lindsay Young. *congressional-record: A parser for the Congressional Record.* Chicago, IL: 2017.

Under a BD3 licence (please see LICENCE). I reproduce the code needed to create the dataset for this piece of work to make the project self-containing but all credit goes to Judd et al.
